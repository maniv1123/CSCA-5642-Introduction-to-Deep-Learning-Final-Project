Loan Default Prediction Using Deep Learning (LendingClub)

This project applies deep learning to predict whether a loan will be fully paid or default, using LendingClub consumer credit data.
A custom Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with categorical embeddings is trained using Keras/TensorFlow, with special focus on:

Class imbalance (very few defaults)

Financial risk indicators

Fairness across borrower groups

Project Overview

Thousands of consumers apply for loans, but only some default. Missing risky borrowers leads to financial loss for lenders.
This project builds a model that:

Detects high-risk borrowers
Handles class imbalance
Evaluates fairness across income and loan purpose groups
